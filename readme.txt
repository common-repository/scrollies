Catch visitor's eye, enlive your website with scrolling sheeps.

== Description ==
This plugin is mainly for having a fun and spreading good vibes. The Scrollies plugin will enlive your website with scrolling sheeps.
According to a situation I will add more animals.

As you are scrolling a webpage, the **sheeps are running**. If you mouse over the sheeps, they will run away. You can see scrolly sheeps live at **[www.FaroeIslands.io](https://www.faroeislands.io/)**

Or you can easily try it on your website. After activation of the Scrollies plugin the sheeps will appear on your website.
In the settings you can change color, shadow and position of the sheeps.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= No sheeps has appeared after activation of the plugin. What to do? =
Sheeps are probably hidden under webpage's sidebar (or other page's element). For this situation there is sheep's z-index in the settings. Enter some number which is higher than z-index of the sidebar. If you don't know it, just try some random numbers (10, 100, 1000, 10000...) until the sheeps will appear.

= Sheeps are displaying even in a gallery lightbox when browsing photos. How to prevent it?  =
You probably set the z-index too high. Set the z-index to some lower value than has a gallery lightbox.

= It is possible to change sheep's color or size dynamicaly according to situation on a page? =
Yes, sheeps are in the form of svg graphics, you can change them via CSS and Javascript.
